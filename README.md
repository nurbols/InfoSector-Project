In this project I used Django Rest Framework which is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Why Rest Framework:

*The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.

*Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.

*Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.

*Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
